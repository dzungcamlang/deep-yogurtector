### Yogurt + Deep Learning + Augmented Reality

## Idea

Build an iOS app helping you to compare products in realtime in a supermarket to find which one is the most healthy and matches your diet.

## Tech

**Product recognition** is made using deeplearning and Tensor Flow. We train a small model recognizing 4 yogurts.

**Augmented reality** is made using ARkit and iOS.
